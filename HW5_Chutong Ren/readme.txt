Running the file 'picture_of_I_stim' you can see the picture of input current.
Running the file 'exercise1' you can see the picture of the results of exercise 1
Running the program 'HH_model_main' you can get the data(Change the code which has been commented out you can get the data from two different inputs).
The 'HH_model_main' costs a lot of time to run, I have set a sigher in the command aera, when test to 9999 the running process is done.
I have put all the results data of HH_model_main to the two mat file, which is corresponds to the two different input, you can also get the data by running the file :)

the file whose name beginns with'exercise2_xxx' is the file, which you can get the picture of exercise 2, all the data they use is from the two different mat file,namely 'data_Istim_1' and 'data_Istim_2'.
